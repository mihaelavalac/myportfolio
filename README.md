# About my-portfolio project.
This project is the first website created from scratch by applying my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I found Bootstrap very helpful and time saving, and I plan to use it in my further mor complicated and interactive projects. The purpose of the project is to create a informative page about me, which contains information, pictures, and contact me professional social media accounts.   

# Content
The website have a basic structure of header, main, footer, and connect three different html files(index.html, portfolio.htm, contact.html).

In the header is included the navigation bar that consist of the title "Mihaela Valac" and three buttons that link the user to the content of their file (About --> index.html || Portfolio --> portfolio.html || Contact --> contact.html) The title of the navigation bar also link the user to the content of index.html.

The main content displays a container which includes different information for each file. 

The index.html includes the "About Me" content which contains a profile picture, a paragraph with information about me, and the icons which are linked to my github and LinkedIn account.

# Level of Dificulty
This project required mor time for research (the meaning of different bootstrap classes and elements and how to change them) than for writing the program, therefore I found it not as complicated. It is a very good starting point for the beginners.
